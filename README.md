# DCGAN-celeba-dataset

Creating Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Neural Network (DCGAN) with aim of being able to generate artificially created images of human faces.

GANs are deep neural networks used to generate new or modify existing content, so that it looks real and genuine to human observer. Examples are rendering landscape photos to look like they were painted by some famous painter (matching his style), or interchanging colors of horses and zebras without else interacting with photo. This is entirely done by AI, without human intervention. Much literature on GANs is readily available online.

### Dataset
